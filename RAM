The files to install your application into multiple directories
have been successfully created.

PACKAGE CONTENTS

The created package includes install-time utilities and application files.

1) Install-time utilities

The utility "xbind" and auxiliary file "xbind.script" created in the directory

	"C:\Users\Cliff\Desktop\Ram-native"

2) Application files

Let $(Root) be the "C:\Users\Cliff\Desktop\Ram-native\Root" directory.

INSTALLATION PROCEDURE

The third-party tool that you use to author setups, has to perform the following
installation procedure on the target system.

STEP 1. Define Placement and Copy Files

First, the installer should

  - define or prompt the user for full paths to $(Root) on the target system;
  - copy the contents of $(Root) "as is" to the locations defined;
  - copy the utility "xbind" and file "xbind.script" to a directory for temporary use.

STEP 2. Create Placement Description File

On this step, the installer has to create a plain ASCII or Unicode text file
with the following contents:

    Root=<full path to the installation directory of $(Root) defined on STEP 1>

Let us call such a file "placement.txt" though you can choose any other name.

For example, if you have arranged a package with two installation directories
$(MyRoot1) and $(MyRoot2), the installer has to create a "placement.txt" file
that contains two lines:

	MyRoot1="E:\Program Files\My Application Dir"
	MyRoot2="E:\Program Files\Common Files\Another Dir"

STEP 3. Hard-wire Placement Settings

On this step, the installer has to run the "xbind" utility by executing the command

	xbind  xbind.script placement.txt [-unicode-redirection]

which hard-wires the placement settings into the JET-compiled executables.

Arguments:

  "xbind.script" is the auxiliary file copied by the installer on STEP 1

  "placement.txt" is the file created by the installer on STEP 2.

  The option "-unicode-redirection" has to be specified if "placement.txt" is
  created using Unicode character set.

 
AUTOMATIC BUILD
 
To build the package without invoking the JetPackII GUI wizard, use the following
command:

	xpack "C:\Users\Cliff\Desktop\Ram.jpn"

The files will be created in the directory

	"C:\Users\Cliff\Desktop\Ram-native".

Advanced build options are described in the JET Users Guide,
chapter "Deployment automation", section "Deployment utilities".
